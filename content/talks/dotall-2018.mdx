<IntroText>
  On the 28th September 2018, for the first time of my life, I stepped on stage
  at an international tech conference. It was scary, but I am still alive! 🤓
</IntroText>

The conference in question is [dotAll 2018](http://dotall.com/2018), the [CraftCMS](CraftCMS) conference held in Berlin, Germany.

The talk went really well. I was nervous at the start (and all along!), but I was very prepared for it and it went - I believe - pretty well.

Here's the video, enjoy! 😎

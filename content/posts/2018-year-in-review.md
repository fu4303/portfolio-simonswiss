<IntroText>Hello, this is super cool!</IntroText>

2017 finished with a talk at SydCSS: [Utility-First CSS: What's all the rage?](#)

In January, I released an egghead course on TailwindCSS: https://egghead.io/courses/build-user-interfaces-by-composing-css-utility-classes-with-tailwind

In March, I conducted my first series of interviews for a front-end developer position at SocietyOne. I organised everything: created the job ad, promoted it, revieiwed applicants, scheduled phone interviews, in-person interviews etc. In April 2018 we hired a fantastic candidate, my now good friend Verity Stothard.

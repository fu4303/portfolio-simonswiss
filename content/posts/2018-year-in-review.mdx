**NOTE**: This post is currently being written. While camping with my family. I could keep it secret, but it's more fun to have it out there, and an incentive to complete it quicker :) Please keep that in mind when you notice typos, grammar issues, unfinished thoughts!

## Starting with a bang 💥

New Year resolutions are fun. Most of the time, they're out the window within a few weeks.

In this case, one thing I **really** wanted to do was to produce an [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) course on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

The sooner the better. I committed early, and within the first two weeks of the year, I was done. My course was in queue for publishing.

A few weeks later, there it was! [Build User Interfaces by Composing CSS Utility Classes with Tailwind](https://egghead.io/courses/build-user-interfaces-by-composing-css-utility-classes-with-tailwind).

As I am writing this post, the course has been completed by **more than 400 people** and has a **rating of 4.6/5** based on 83 ratings!

## Building a team 💪

In March, I organised my first series of interviews, as we were hiring for a front-end developer position at [SocietyOne](https://societyone.com.au)

I was responsible for creating the job ad, promoting it, reviewing applicants, scheduling phone interviews, in-person interviews etc.

I surprisingly _really enjoyed_ the whole process. I think I was pretty good at it too! A few applicants mentioned they found the whole procedure very friendly and well conducted. 🤗

In April, we hired a fantastic candidate, my now good friend [Verity Stothard](https://twitter.com/VerityStothard), who turned out to be a great fit!

## Berlin Bound! ✈️🍻

This is a big one for me. One of these _way out of the comfort zone_ thing.

But yeah, my talk proposal for the [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) conference was accepted, and I found myself <Link to="/talks/real-life-journey-utility-first-css">on stage to close day 1 of DotAll 2018</Link>!

## Laracon AU 🇦🇺

Same talk, different crowd. My second ever conference talk, and also the second in three weeks!

## B'ball Championship 🏀🏆

Yeah!

## Landed a new job 🙌

This is going to be pretty cool.

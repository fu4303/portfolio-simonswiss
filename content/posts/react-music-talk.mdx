Last Monday, I took a leap of faith and made my first public speaking appearance at a Sydney tech meetup. The event in questions was React Sydney, a monthly event where tickets go like hot cakes and waiting lists get notoriously long.

The topic I came to talk about was React-Music, an awesome open-source project that lets you create beats with ReactJS. React-Music is a creation by Ken Wheeler, director of open-source at FormidableLabs.

The talk went really well, considering it was heavily relying on live demos, which could have gone horribly wrong‚Ä¶ :)

Here are links to the slides of the talk, as well as to the github repo with the live demos presented during the talk.
